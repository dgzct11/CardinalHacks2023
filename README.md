## Cardinal Care
## Inspiration

Our team identified a pressing issue in healthcare: medication misuse. Recognizing the need for a technology-driven approach to this challenge, we decided to create Cardinal Care.

## What It Does

Cardinal Care is an application crafted to bridge the gap between doctors and patients, with a spotlight on the medication administration process. Through streamlined communication, Cardinal Care aims to minimize potential mishaps and confusions regarding prescriptions, thereby safeguarding patients' health.

## How We Built It

From a full team of four, we split into two pairs: one working on the front-end and the other working on the back-end. From the back-end we used MongoDB as our database and Next.js as our platform of choice to create our application. We went through multiple iterations of trying to use GoogleCloud and Redis before eventually settling on MongoDB as the most effective database. On the front-end, we used TypeScript and Tailwind CSS to create an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing website for users to access and use, designing login pages and dashboards for patients and doctors.

## Challenges We Ran Into

Embarking on this journey marked our first encounter with a hackathon environment. Despite each member of our team possessing a robust foundation in theoretical computer science, translating this theory into practice presented its own challenges. From troubleshooting unexpected bugs to navigating rookie errors, our journey was enlightening.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of

Given our constraints - both temporal and experience-wise - the completion of Cardinal Care is a triumph in its own right. We've not only created a functioning platform but also managed to bring to life our initial vision: a tool that is intuitive, beneficial for both patients and doctors.

## What We Learned

The voyage from abstract theory to tangible application is paved with challenges. Through this project, our team gained insights into the intricacies of software development, honed our problem-solving skills, and discovered the pivotal role teamwork plays in the success of a project.

## What's Next for Cardinal AI

The horizon for Cardinal Care in the healthcare domain is vast. We envision refining its current capabilities, incorporating predictive algorithms to flag potential medication conflicts, and collaborating with healthcare entities to weave Cardinal Care seamlessly into extant systems.

## Built With

    - Auth0: For robust and scalable user authentication.
    - MongoDB: As our go-to NoSQL database.
    - Next.js: Our choice for server-rendered React applications.
    - TailwindCSS: For utility-first CSS management.
    - TypeScript: Bringing static typing to JavaScript, enhancing our code reliability.
